# Dotys

Epic dotfiles in haskell.

Xmobar and Xmonad (And trayer-srg)


Preferably installed on a fresh [Arch](archlinux.org) (NOT ARTIX FOR THE LOVE OF GOD) install.

These dotties took alot to make, after my shit setup with DT code i finally made something not copy and pasted, as my config and in my [github](https://github.com/alexfeed1990).

Thanks to the [r/unixporn discord](https://discord.gg/d53yESY) i was finally able to finish this.

And no, im not making an install script. Figure it out yourself or add me on discord or whatever.
